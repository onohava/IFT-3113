# Twinlights (Project IFT-3113)

**A 2D Puzzle-Platformer exploring the duality of Light and Dark.**

## 🎮 About The Game

Created as part of the **IFT-3113 (Projet de jeu vidéo)** course at **Université Laval**, this project is a 2D puzzle-platformer built in **Unity**.

The game evolves around the mechanics of **Light** and **Dark**. Heavily inspired by classic cooperative games like *Fireboy and Watergirl*, players must navigate through complex levels where elements of the environment react differently depending on the active state or character.

> **Core Concept:** Cooperation between opposites, with limited visibility.
